This ion specific sampler aims to place electrons in a suitable position
based on the atomic number of the ion. Based on the work of Simas et al.
in "The radial charge distribution and the shell structure of atoms and
ions", who computed the radial charge distribution D(r) from hydrogen
through uranium of neutral atoms.

Stuff to note:
    At most 5 shells are apparent.
    The positions of the maxima in D(r) are shown to correlate with
    the shell radii from the Bohr-Schroedinger model of the atom.
    Slater-type function with radial part R(r) = Cr^(n-1)exp(-zeta*r)
    leads to a D(r) that peaks at r = n/zeta.
    n : principal atomic number
    zeta : effective atomic number based on shielding from inner
    electrons.
    C = (2*zeta)^n * sqrt(2zeta/(2n)!

The program could take each electron, assign them a random angular
component and place the electron radially according to the modal
position for that orbital. Alternatively it could use the slater-type
function detailed above as a probability density function for a random
sampler. The former method is likely much easier as the peaks are well
defined.
